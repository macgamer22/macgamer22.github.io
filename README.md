This is my first edit of Readme file.

All my repositories are public and can be modified. Most of my repositories are from learning and school activities in MIT xPro, Fullstack Development Bootcamp.

It is updated or I will upload files weekly or as soon as I have new shcool activities and assignments.

Most of these repositories are answer and studies of the modules we have as we progress our learning of Fullstack Development.

I will be formatting and will organize this soon as I get more in depth with Javascript coding.
