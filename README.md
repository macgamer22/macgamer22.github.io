My name is Jules and this is readme version 2.0.

All my repositories are public and can be use for educational purposes.

Every single one of the repositories are intended for learning and school activities in MIT xPro, Fullstack Development Bootcamp.

Most of these repositories are homework and self-study of the modules we have as we progress and learn through the course.
